						Ibadan, (Yoruba: Ìbàdàn or fully Ìlú Ẹ̀bá-Ọ̀dàn, the town at the junction of the savannah and the forest), is the capital of Oyo State, located on seven hills (average elevation 700 feet [200 metres]) about 100 miles (160 km) from the Atlantic coast. It is about 100km east of Lagos, the commercial nerve centre of Nigeria. It is one of the most populous cities in the country, the 3rd largest city in Nigeria after Kano and Lagos. It is an ancient city founded in 1829 and with a very rich cultural heritage. At independence, Ibadan was the largest and the most populous city in Nigeria and the third in Africa after Cairo and Johannesburg. Its central location and accessibility from the capital city of Lagos were major considerations in the choice of Ibadan as the headquarters of the Western Provinces (1939), which became the Western Region of Nigeria in 1952. It has a history of firsts, having the first university in Nigeria (University of Ibadan), founded in 1948 as part of the University of London; the first standard stadium in Nigeria (Obafemi Awolowo Stadium formerly Liberty Stadium), the first multistory building in Nigeria (Cocoa House) and the first television station in Africa (NTA Ibadan). It is the location for International Institute for Tropical Agriculture (IITA). Until 1970, it was the largest sub Saharan city in Africa. The city of Ibadan is naturally drained by four rivers with many tributaries: Ona River in the North and West; Ogbere River towards the East; Ogunpa River flowing through the city and Kudeti River in the Central part of the metropolis. Tourist attractions in Ibadan include: Agodi Gardens and Leisure Park. The Palms shopping mall, Ring Road. Ventura Mall, Samonda. University of Ibadan Zoological Garden. Bower Tower. Mapo Hall. Kankanfo Inn, etc.
					</p>
					  <p class="card card-body-text">
						  Getting to Ibadan: AIR <br>
						  Ibadan has an airport, though only local flights land there. The airport is just about 30 minutes by taxi to the IITA conference centre.
						  Nigeria has three International Airports. One in Abuja, the nation’s capital city, another in Port Harcourt and the 3rd is in Lagos, the commercial nerve centre of Nigeria. You can only get flights to Ibadan from Abuja on weekdays, and usually there are no flights from Lagos to Ibadan since it is just about an hour and a half drive from the Murtala Mohammed International airport in Lagos.
							<br>
						  Our proposed hosting venue, IITA, has a shuttle service by road from the Lagos Airport to the conference venue for 90 USD. The is the method we recommend for getting to the conference venue. There are usually taxis at the airport if you do not want the shuttle.
					  </p>


					  <p class="card card-body-text">
						  Getting to Ibadan: ROAD <br>
						  For the most people, road travel from Lagos to Ibadan is the default way of between the two cities.  It is cheaper than air travel and also affords passengers a chance to take in the scenic route. Even though road travel between the two cities is popular, finding a ride for your trip, may prove to be challenging if you don’t know what to do. We’ve prepared a quick and easy guide to help you on your journey from Lagos to Ibadan.
						  <br>
						  Shared cars and buses are available from multiple bus terminals in Lagos for about 1000 Naira. The journey takes about two hours along the heavily trafficked Lagos-Ibadan expressway, and buses arrive in the southern part of the city. Private taxis can be hired from Lagos from 30-50 USD.
					  </p>
					  <p class="card card-body-text">
						  Oshodi Motor Park <br>
						  At the Oshodi Park, you will find a selection of vehicles bound for Ibadan.  The average bus fare costs about N1300.

					  </p>
					  <p class="card card-body-text">
						  Ojota Motor Park <br>
						  If you are staying in central Lagos Mainland, Ojota Motor Park is likely to be most suitable for you.   Inside the Park, you would find minivans and buses ready to transport you to Ibadan. The transport fare generally ranges from N1,200 -N1,500 naira depending on the type of vehicle.

					  </p>
					  <p class="card card-body-text">
						  Ikorodu Motor Park<br>
						  At Ikorodu, you can find the several types of vehicles, such as taxis, minivans, and buses. The bus fare is within the range of 1,000-1,200 Naira and the taxi fare goes for 1,400- 1,600 Naira.
						  On getting into Ibadan, your bus is likely to terminate somewhere Iwo Road. From Iwo Road, you can find transport means to all parts of the city. Have a safe trip!
						  Regional buses connect Ibadan to all major towns in Southwestern Nigeria, including Abeokuta, Ife, and Oyo. Night buses also connect the city to the north, via Kaduna, and the east.

					  </p>
					  <p class="card card-body-text">
						  Getting around Ibadan:<br>
						  There is an extensive network of minibuses and shared cars. A journey from one end of the city to the other costs around 80 Naira. Okadas (motorcycle taxis) are cheap and available everywhere, though some drivers are erratic.

				  	<p class="card-body-text">ACURET, has conducted two editions a 5-days Intensive workshop with practical hands-on on Essentials of Responsible Animal Based Experimentation [RANEXT basics] in conjunction with the Nigerian Institute of Medical Research, Yaba providing knowledge and skills to young scientists, researchers, Faculty, Medical and Veterinary professionals, graduate students and lab animal technologist from across the country. This project is raising the bar on the number of Africans skilled in humane animal care and use for scientific purposes, who are expected to return to their Institutions and put into practice the knowledge and skills acquired from the training. In this regard, they are required to voluntarily submit their animal experimentation protocol proposal to a properly constituted and effectively functional IACUC for review and approve BEFORE they begin their work. The absence of this structure in your Institution could become a hindrance to their application of best clinical practices. The Number of such trained and skilled researchers are rising across Nigerian Universities, which MUST be complemented by functional IACUC/AEC</p>
				  <p class="card-body-text">Does your University have a properly constituted Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee or Animal Ethics Committee? Please do not take this to mean the same as the Ethical Committee with oversight for human participation in research, such as HREC.  The mandates are completely different and the modus operandi diverse. For instance, while humans participating in research have the opportunity to make an ‘informed consent’ for their participation, animals on the other hand, do not; hence the approach to the ethical consideration for animals used in research must be different.</p>

				  			<p class="card-body-text">Reproducibility and clinical translatability are central to the scientific value of animal studies in biomedical research. Reproducibility refers to the ability to replicate the outcomes of an animal study by the same or different investigators. Clinical translatability recognizes the intent of biomedical research to advance human health and refers to the ability to “translate” outcomes or insights from animal studies to human patients. Since scientific value is a central underpinning of animal research ethics, these topics are squarely in the line of sight of the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC).</p>
				 			<p class="card-body-text">However, many Nigerian Institutions today use animals in experiments for biomedical research without the benefits of an oversight IACUC. This is a major reason why several PIs find it difficult to publish their manuscripts reporting these studies, as most Editors of Biomedical journals now demand evidence for the ethical approval of the study by a properly constituted IACUC. </p>
					  		<p class="card-body-text">ACURET would be ecstatic to work with you and those with interest in this matter to achieve voluntary self-regulated humane animal care and use for scientific purposes at your Institution. ACURET intends working with Nigerian Institutions to resolve this dilemma by training selected delegates (from amongst the committee members) in line with the provisions of the mandate of the oie, the Guide and International Principles for the use of animals in Biomedical research. These will return to train their entire committee to establish a well-functioning IACUC that will strive to nurture an institutional culture that places value in enhancing the scientific quality of research to help assure the reproducibility of animal studies and translational success of animal models. This is integral to both high quality science as well as excellence in the supporting animal care and use.</p>

It is planned to hold from 23rd – 26th July, 2019 at the International Institute of Tropical Agriculture (IITA) Ibadan, Conference Center, a serene state-of-the-art conference facility located within the IITA Forest reserve that affords participants every opportunity to maximize the benefits of the gathering. ACURET intends to train a delegation of three (3) from your Institution during this event. Preferably current members of your Institutional Animal Ethics Committee OR, where you are yet to have such a committee in place, individuals appointable to this committee upon their return from the training. Institutional Animal Care and Use Committees (IACUCs) have a mandated role under the World Organization for Animal Health charter, (Nigeria is a signatory) to assure the ethical and humane use of research animals in experiments conducted in Nigerian Institutions. The IACUC by virtue of its mandated functions is well positioned to help nurture and foster an institutional culture of optimized animal use working with the concepts of the 3Rs (refinement, reduction, replacement), while encouraging high quality reproducible studies that contribute to translational success.
